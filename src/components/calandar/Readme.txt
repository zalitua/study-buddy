To use the CalendarPage component ito the component youre working on you can use this import statement:

import CalendarPage from './components/CalendarPage';

You can also add the calendarpage component to your routes using this route:

<Route path="/calendar" element={<CalendarPage />} />

what the page does- the calendar component gives users a calendar view to check and manage group members' availabilities and due dates. The component gets availability data based on the selected date and displays it in an interactive way.
