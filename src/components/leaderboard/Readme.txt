Importing the Component
To use the LeaderboardPage component into the compnent you're working on you can use this import statement:

import Leaderboard from './components/Leaderboard';

You can also add the LeaderboardPage component to your routes using this route:

<Route path="/leaderboard" element={<Leaderboard />} />

The Leaderboard component displays a ranking of users based on their scores or achievements. It dynamically fetches and updates this data, presenting it in an interactive format for easy viewing and comparison.
